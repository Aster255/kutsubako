These shoes are designed to help you swing stronger and recover quicker between shots. ​Novak has a zero-step shot. This means that he’s swinging his racquet when he lands. By increasing the outsole’s contact area, the shoe creates a stable landing and reduces the load placed on the body. As a result, you’re able to put more energy into generating a powerful swing. ​For a smoother crossover step, this shoe allows you to perform quicker turns in a shorter timeframe.
